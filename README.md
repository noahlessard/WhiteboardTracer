# WhiteboardTracer
A C++ program I wrote (with foxxy as help) to convert images to an outline so I can trace them on whiteboards with a projector

The source code is really messy, but it outputs 2 files using 2 different tracing methods. Usually output_canny is better than output_lines, but not all the time so I left them both in.

Just run the executable for a prompt to enter an image and go!
